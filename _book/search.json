    "text": "1.1 Discplines in BS3008\nBS3008 covers numerous disciplines, including the following. A brief explanation on what each discipline is is also provided for each of the disciplines:\n\nChemoinformatics\nThis discipline deals with similarities and differences between chemical compounds.\nBioinformatics\nThis disciplines applies informatics tools (e.g., Python coding) to Biological molecules and data.\nTheoretical Chemistry (i.e., Quantum Chemistry)\nThis discipline provides the theoretical foundations needed to understand the course’s contents.\nComputational Chemistry and Biology\nThis discipline not only encompasses theoretical chemistry, but also molecular mechanics, minimization, simulations, and conformational analysis.\nMolecular Modelling\nThis discipline uses all of the above disciplines to represent and manipulate the structures of molecules.\n\nHence, BS3008 primarily focuses on molecular modelling (with emphasis on theoretical chemistry for the theoretical component of the course).\n\n1.1.1 What is Molecular Modelling?\nAccording to Tamar Schlick, molecular modelling is:\n\n“…the science and art of studying molecular structure and function through model building and computation.”\n– Tamar Schlick\n\n“Computation” in this sense refer to practices such as:\n\nab initio and semi-empirical quantum mechanics\nMolecular mechanics\nMonte Carlo simulations\nMolecular dynamics\nFree energy and solvation methods\nStructure / activity relationships (i.e., SAR analyses)\nChemical / biochemical information and databases\n\nIt is important to understand that while “model building” can be as simple as using plastic or metal rods to depict molecules’ structures, it can also be as sophisticated as an interactive, animated color graphics and lasers.\nNonetheless, the computational tools used in molecular modelling is just as, if not more complex than Biological systems. However, the concepts in molecular modelling must be carefully applied and one must also be wary of molecular modeling’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n1.1.2 Important Databases and Tools\nProfessor Mu lists some important molecular modelling tools in this chapter - click on their hyperlinks to access them:\n\nPDB\nThis is a database with numerous entries on proteins’ information.\nPDBBinding\nThis is another database that provides entries on the binding affinity for all biomolecular complexes.\nZINK DOCK\n\nAutodock Zina\nThis is an open-source program for performing molecular docking.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Molecular Mechanics in Molecular Modelling\nMolecular modelling started with the idea that molecular geometry, energy, and other molecular properties could be calculated from models (that are influenced by basic forces).\nA molecule - hence - is a system of particles (i.e., atoms) connected by springs (i.e., bonds). This molecule is free to rotate, vibrate, and adopt a favorable conformation in space as a result of the inter- and intramolecular forces acting upon it."

Hence, we can say that:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_{tot} = E_p + E_k\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(E_{tot}\\) is the total energy of the system.\nSince \\(r\\) represents the distance between both molecules, therefore \\(E_p(r) = 0\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\vec{F} = \\frac{\\partial E_p(\\vec{x})}{\\partial \\vec{x}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe force1 \\(\\vec{F}\\) on the system is denoted via the above equation.\nSince \\(E_p(r) = 0\\) in the first figure, it follows that \\(F(r) = 0\\).\n\n\n1.2.2 Case #2\n\n\n\n\n\nA System with Two Charged Molecules\n\n\n\n\nHere, the charge \\(V_{ele}\\) and the potential energy \\(E_p(r)\\) is given via the following equations:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  V_{ele}(r) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{q_1}{r} \\\\\n  E_p(r) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSome important considerations to think about include the variables and the parameters of the system.\n\n\n1.2.3 Case #3\n\n\n\n\n\nA System with Two Molecules and their Energy Graph\n\n\n\n\nIn this system, we let:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_p(r) = 4\\epsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this system, we also note that \\(E_p(r) = 0\\) when \\(r = \\sigma\\) and that \\(\\displaystyle E_p(\\sqrt[6]{2}\\sigma) = -\\epsilon\\).\nDo also consider the variables and parameters in this system (and whether or not both particles in this system can move freely).\n\n\n1.2.4 Case #4\n\n\n\n\n\nA System with Two Molecules and their Energy Graph\n\n\n\n\nHere, we define the system’s potential energy \\(E_p\\) as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_p(r) = \\frac{1}{2}k(r - r_0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhile the energy graph for this system appears to be that of bonding, it is still important to consider the variables and the parameters of the system.\nWe can also further decompose the above equation to its spatial components \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) and say that:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nE_p(r) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x - x_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(y - y_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(z - z_0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this sub-case, the system appears to be a lattice. However, are the particles still movable?"

This is in contrast to electrostatic charges and van der Waals forces: intra- and intermolecular bonding.\n\n2.1.1 Bond Stretching\nThe Morse potential \\(E(l)\\) and the Harmonic potential \\(a\\) are:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  E(l) &= D_e\\{1 - \\exp[-a(l - l_0)]\\}^2 \\\\\n  a &= \\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{2D_e}}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\(D_e\\) in the above equations represent the depth of the potential energy minimum:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Potential Energy Graph Between an Oxygen Atom and a Hydrogen Atom\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\omega\\) represents the bond vibration frequency, \\(\\mu\\) the reduced mass, and \\(l_0\\) the reference bond length1\n\n2.1.1.1 At Room Temperature (i.e., 298 K)\nIn such a case, the thermal kinetic energy of the system (i.e., molecule) falls within \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}k_BT\\) and \\(300 K\\). An approximation for the thermal kinetic energy \\(E_{thermal}\\) is about 0.3 kcal / mol. We can also say that:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  E(l) &= \\frac{1}{2}k(l - l_0)^2 \\\\\n  k &= 2D_ea^2 = \\mu\\omega^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nAt room temperature, the energy potential of a molecule can be described via the following graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Potential Energy Well at Room Temperature\n\n\n\n\nThis graph is also called a Hooke’s spring.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Angle Bending\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on Several Bond Angles\n\n\n\n\nBecause of a covalent bond’s directionality, its bond angles do not change that much.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E(\\theta) = \\frac{k}{2}(\\theta - \\theta_0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTherefore, Hooke’s law is often used to calculate the harmonic potential energy of a certain type of bond angle.\n\n\n2.1.3 Torison Terms\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Mu’s Slides on Torsion Terms and Dihedral Angles\n\n\n\n\nThe torsional energy is defined between every quartet of atoms - it depends on the dihedral angle \\(\\phi\\) made by two planes (and also incorporating the first and last three terms in the torsion).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E(\\psi) = \\sum_{n = 0}^N\\frac{V_n}{2}[1 + \\cos(n\\psi - \\psi_0)]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTorsional motions are typically hundreds of times less stiff than bond stretching motions.\nTorsion terms also mimic bonding characteristics and neighboring atoms’ and their side groups’ steric hindrances about the chain axis.\n\n2.1.3.1 Exammple Torsional Terms for Ethane\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Torsional Term for an Ethane Molecule\n\n\n\n\nNote that the y-axis of the above graphic is in kcal / mol.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Non-Bonded Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\nNomenclature for Non-Bonded Interactions\n\n\n\n\nThe kind of bonded interactions depend on the bonding relationship between atoms. Such energy functions in this scenario describe the total interactions between atoms and cannot be further decomposed.\n\n\n2.1.5 Electrostatic Interactions\nThis is a group in its own right - the other group of non-bonded terms is van der Waals interactions.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_{ele} = \\sum_{i > j}\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_iq_j}{r_{ij}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn a simple model consisting of two water molecules, their partial charges are \\(q_O = -0.834\\) and \\(q_H = 0.417\\).\n\n2.1.5.1 Calculating Partial Charges\nA molecule’s electrostatic potential can be measured - it can also be determined from molecular wavefunctions (from quantum mechanics):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  R = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{points}}(\\phi_i^{calc} - \\phi_i^0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe goal is to find a set partial charge from which the calculated potentials are closest to the reference ones.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 van der Waals Interactions\nThey arise from a balance between attractive and repulsive forces.\nThe attractive force is due to dispersion forces and is equivalent to \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{r^6}\\). The repulsive force originates from quantum mechanics and can be understood using Pauli’s exclusion principle.\n\n2.1.6.1 Lennard-Jones Potential\nThe Lennard-Jones 12-6 function \\(\\displaystyle 4\\epsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6\\right]\\) has two adjustable parameters:\n\nCollision diameter \\(\\sigma\\)\nWell depth \\(\\sigma\\)\n\nThe \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{r^{12}}\\) is questionable at times, but also allows for rapid computations.\n\n\n2.1.6.2 Combination Rules\nA way to approximate parameters is needed to calculate the van der Waals interactions between different kinds of atoms.\nThere are two methods covered in BS3008:\n\nAmber and Charmm\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\epsilon_{ij} &= \\sqrt{\\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j} \\\\\n  \\sigma_{ij} &= \\frac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe Lorentz-Berthelodt rules are used.\nOPLS2 Force Fields\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\epsilon_{ij} &= \\sqrt{\\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j} \\\\\n  \\sigma_{ij} &= \\sqrt{\\sigma_i\\sigma_j}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n2.1.6.3 Parameters of van der Waals Forces\nThe Lennard Johnson (i.e., LJ) parameters state the following:\n\nHeat of vaporization\nDensity (i.e., molecular volume)\nPartial Molar Volume\nCrystal simulations"
