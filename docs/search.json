A brief explanation on what each discipline is is also provided for each of the disciplines:\n\nChemoinformatics\nThis discipline deals with similarities and differences between chemical compounds.\nChemoinformatics deals with compounds from \\(10^{-60}\\) to \\(10^{-30}\\) in magnitudes. Individuals who work in this field try to find “an island in an ocean” - they try to find a molecule that can do some purpose.\nBioinformatics\nThis disciplines applies informatics tools (e.g., Python coding) to Biological molecules and data.\nBioinformatics mainly focuses on Biological modelling.\nTheoretical Chemistry (i.e., Quantum Chemistry)\nThis discipline provides the theoretical foundations needed to understand the course’s contents.\nComputational Chemistry and Biology\nThis discipline not only encompasses theoretical chemistry, but also molecular mechanics, minimization, simulations, and conformational analysis.\nMolecular Modelling\nThis discipline uses all of the above disciplines to represent and manipulate the structures of molecules.\nThis also means that this discipline uses physics to model a system - that way, a model can be compared against experimental results.\n\nHence, BS3008 primarily focuses on molecular modelling (with emphasis on theoretical chemistry for the theoretical component of the course).\n\n1.1.1 What is Molecular Modelling?\nAccording to Tamar Schlick, molecular modelling is:\n\n“…the science and art of studying molecular structure and function through model building and computation.”\n– Tamar Schlick\n\n“Computation” in this sense refer to practices such as:\n\nab initio and semi-empirical quantum mechanics\nMolecular mechanics\nMonte Carlo simulations\nMolecular dynamics\nFree energy and solvation methods\nStructure / activity relationships (i.e., SAR analyses)\nChemical / biochemical information and databases\n\nIt is important to understand that while “model building” can be as simple as using plastic or metal rods to depict molecules’ structures, it can also be as sophisticated as an interactive, animated color graphics and lasers.\nNonetheless, the computational tools used in molecular modelling is just as, if not more complex than Biological systems. However, the concepts in molecular modelling must be carefully applied and one must also be wary of molecular modeling’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n1.1.2 Important Databases and Tools\nProfessor Mu lists some important molecular modelling tools in this chapter - click on their hyperlinks to access them:\n\nPDB\nThis is a database with numerous entries on proteins’ information.\nPDBBinding\nThis is another database that provides entries on the binding affinity for all biomolecular complexes.\nZINK DOCK\n\nAutodock Zina\nThis is an open-source program for performing molecular docking."

    "text": "2.1 Born-Oppenheimer Approximation\nThis technique in computational chemistry leads to a later concept: potential energy surfaces (i.e., PES). A PES is a graph that describes the energy of a molecule (i.e., a system) in terms of certain parameters\nFor molecules that have many electrons, their wavefunction is a combination of electron and nuclear coordinates. Their wavefunctions can be represented as \\(\\psi(R, r)\\), where \\(R\\) are the nuclear coordinates and \\(r\\) the electron coordinates.\nHowever, nuclei are way heavier than electrons, nuclei also move much slower than electrons.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\psi(R, r) = \\psi_{et}(r; R)\\psi_N(R)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows us to separate electrons and nuclear motion via the above wavefunction approximation.\n\n2.1.1 Schrodinger’s Equation\nThe time-independent Schrodinger equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\hat{H}\\psi &= E\\psi \\\\\n  \\hat{H} &= \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{H}\\) is the Hamiltonian, \\(\\psi\\) the wavefunction, and \\(E\\) the total amount of energy in the system.\n\\(T\\) represents kinetic energy and \\(V\\) the potential energy.\n\n\n2.1.2 Solutions of the Schrodinger Equation\nThe equation can only be solved for simple cases (e.g., particle in a box, hydrogen atoms, rigid rotors, etc). For more complex solutions, some assumptions will need to be made.\nSolving this equation also attempts to expand the wave function \\(\\psi\\) into one of many Slater determinants - these are represented by molecular orbitals: linear combinations of atomic-like-orbital functions.\nYet, it is still possible to get very accurate results. Generally speaking, the cost of calculation increases with the accuracy of the calculation (and the size of the system).\n\n\n2.1.3 Electronic Schrodinger Equation\nThis equation is as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\hat{H}_{el}\\psi_{el}(r; R) &=  E_{el}\\psi_{el}(r; R) \\\\\n  \\hat{H}_{el} &= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\sum_i\\nabla_i^2 - \\sum_\\alpha\\sum_i\\frac{Z_\\alpha e'^2}{r_{i\\alpha}} + \\sum_j\\sum_{i > j}\\frac{e'^2}{r_{ij}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn a typical potential energy graph, the potential energy takes a dip within a certain distance before it goes up:\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Energy Graph for HgBr\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above graph, the following formulas can be derived:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  U(R) &= E_{el} + V_{NN} \\\\\n  V_{NN} &= \\sum_\\alpha \\sum_{\\alpha > \\beta}\\frac{Z_\\alpha Z_\\beta e'^2}{r_{\\alpha\\beta}}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n2.1.4 Nuclear Schrodinger Equation\nOnce a potential energy surface (i.e., PES) has been obtained for a molecule, one can solve the nuclear Schrodinger equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\hat{H}_N\\psi_N(R) &= E_N\\psi_N(R) \\\\\n  \\hat{H}_N &= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\sum_\\alpha\\frac{1}{m_\\alpha}\\nabla_\\alpha^2 + U(R)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe solutions of this equation allow one to determine a large amount of molecular properties - for instance, vibrational energy levels.\n\n\n2.1.5 Polyatomic PESes\nWhere there are more than one parameters that are used to describe a molecule’s PES, the degrees of freedom is given by \\(3n - 6\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of atoms in the system."

The eigenfunctions describing these spins are denoted as \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\nElectron spin also obeys the following principles:\n\nIndisguinshability\nAll electrons that are spin-up are identical to one another.\nPauli’s Exclusion Principle\nNo two electrons can be described by the same set of quantum numbers.\n\nWhenever two electrons are interchanged, the signs of their wavefunctions are also changed - for instance:\nIf a wave function \\(\\psi = \\psi_a(1)\\alpha(1)\\psi_b(2)\\alpha(2)\\) is inverted, the result is \\(\\psi_a(2)\\alpha(2)\\psi_b(1)\\alpha(1) - \\psi_a(1)\\alpha(1)\\psi_b(2)\\alpha(2)\\).\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Slater Determinants\nAfter performing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, one then determines the expansion of the electron wavefunction \\(\\psi_{el}\\) via Slater determinants:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\psi_{el} = \\sum_id_i\\phi_i = d_0\\phi_0 + d_1\\phi_1 + d_2\\phi_2 + ...\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe Slater determinant \\(\\phi_0\\) is given via the below matrix. One can also choose to think about Slater determinants as a kind of “configuration” (i.e., ground-state neon might go something like \\(\\psi_0\\) = 1s22s22p6 and so on).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\phi_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\left[\n  \\begin{matrix}\n    \\phi_1\\alpha(1) & \\phi_1\\beta(1) & \\phi_2\\alpha(1) & ... & \\phi_M\\beta(1) \\\\\n    \\phi_1\\alpha(2) & \\phi_1\\beta(2) & \\phi_2\\alpha(2) & ... & \\phi_M\\beta(1) \\\\\n    ... & .... & ... & ... & ... \\\\\n    \\phi_1\\alpha(N) & \\phi_1\\beta(N) & \\phi_2\\alpha(N) & ... & \\phi_M\\beta(N)    \n  \\end{matrix}\n  \\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the spin-up and spin-down functions respectively.\n\\(\\psi_i\\) the spatial functions\n\\(\\psi_i\\alpha\\) and \\(\\psi_i\\beta\\) the spin-orbitals\n\nSlater determinants give proper anti-symmetry (i.e., the Pauli Exclusion Principle).\n\n\n2.2.3 Hartree-Fock Approximations\nIt is impractical (and impossible) to consider all configurations of a system \\(\\phi_i\\). Hence, the Hartree-Fock approximation is often used to approximate the wavefunction for the complete set of \\(\\phi_i\\)s using a single determinant \\(\\psi_0\\).\nIn this method, Self-consistent field energies (i.e., SCF energies) are used instead to find an optimal set of molecular orbitals for \\(\\psi_0\\).\nEach electron in this approximation only sees an average repulsion of the remaining electrons.\n\n2.2.3.1 How Accurate is the Approximation?\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Accuracy of a Hartree-Fock Approximation on a CO Molecule\n\n\n\n\nHartree-Fock wavefunctions usually approximate about 99% of the total energy. Hartree-Fock approximations can also be used to predict bond angles, thermochemistry measurements (e.g., enthalpy), and even vibrational force constants.\nQuantum chemists are typically interested in energy differences and not total energies.\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Electron Correlations\nThe electron correlation is the energy difference between an experimentally measured value (i.e., the “exact” value) and value obtained from a Hartree-Fock approximation. In more empirical terms:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_{corr} = E_{exact} - E_{HF}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe \\(E_{corr}\\) accounts for missing electron-electron interactions in the Hartree-Fock method.\nBecause of this, the Hartree-Fock approximation is often used as a “starting point” for finding the wavefunction.\nDo also note that different correlation methods also exist - depending on which values of \\(\\phi_i\\) and \\(d_i\\) to use, the value of \\(E_{corr}\\) might change.\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Configuration Interactions\nFirst suppose the following about electron wavefunction:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\psi_{el} = d_0\\phi_{HF} + \\sum_{i = 1}d_i\\phi_i\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe above assumption uses the linear variation principle: the amount energy in a wavefunction is always equal to or great than the true energy.\nSome other possible configurations (i.e., methods) include:\n\nCISD\nThis is short for Configuration Interaction with Single and Double excitations. All determinants of “s” and “d” type orbitals are used.\nMRCI\nThis is short for Multireference Configuration Interaction.\n\nBoth CISD and MRCI can be very accurate, but they also take a long time to process.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Mollet-Plesset (i.e., MP) Perturbation Theory\nPerturbation methods such as these assume that the problem at hand (i.e., \\(\\psi\\) and \\(E\\)) only differ slightly from a solved problem (i.e., \\(HF_{\\psi}\\) and \\(E\\)).\nThe energy is calculated via various orders of approximations. At MP2, the calculation involves single and double excitations; higher MPs result in costlier calculations.\n\n\n2.2.5 Coupled Cluster (i.e., CC) Theory\nThis theory leads to accurate wavefunction expansions (and yields accurate electronic charges).\nSome common variants of this include:\n\nCCSD\nWhich includes single and double CCs, hence its name.\nCCSD(T)\nThis is the same as CCSD, albeit with treatments of triple excitations. This method uses accurate results when used on large basis sets.\nIt’s possible to get thermochemical results (i.e., enthalpy) with good accuracy.\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Frozen Core Approximations\nHere, only valence orbitals are involved in chemical bonding processes. Core orbitals don’t change much when atoms are involved in molecules (as opposed to when atoms are free).\nBecause of this, most electronic structure calculations only correlate with the frozen electrons (i.e., the core orbitals are kept frozen).\n\n\n2.2.7 Density Frozen Theory\nThe wavefunction is generally uninterpretable1.\nNonetheless, a useful physical observation would be an atom’s electron density \\(\\rho\\) as it gives the total number of electrons over space.\nDensity Functional Theory solves for electron density. The cost of such method is similar to Hartree-Fock approximations (and usually involve some of empirical parameterization).\nThis approach is often the best choice when dealing with large molecules."

Quantum chemists found via experimentation that \\(M = 3\\) gave the best combination of speed and accuracy.\nTo increase the flexibility of a basis set, one might choose to take a STO-3G basis set and construct two basis functions for each atomic orbital. The first atomic orbital could be a contraction of the first two primitive Gaussians while the second could be a normalized third primitive. A basis with two functions for each atomic orbital is called a double-\\(\\zeta\\) basis.\nMore decontractions are possible - this would give rise to higher, multiple-\\(\\xeta\\) basis sets. More examples of such sets include cc-pCVDZ and cc-pCVTZ.\n\n\n2.3.4 Polarization Functions\nDue to the utility of atomic-orbital-like gaussian type orbitals, this amount of flexibility is often provided in the form of one quantum number higher of higher angular momentum than the valence orbitals. Thus, for a first-row atom, the most useful polarization function are d-GTOs2, and for hydrogens, p-GTOs.\nAdding a d-function to nitrogen’s basis set causes Hartree-Fock approximations to correctly predict a trigonal pyrimidal shape for ammonica.\n\n\n2.3.5 Diffuse Functions\nThe highest-energy molecular orbitals of anions, highly-excited electron states, and loose supermolecular complexes are more spatially diffuse than garden-variety molecular orbitals.\nWhen a basis set doesn’t have enough flexibility to allow a weakly-bonded electron to localize far from the remaining density, significant errors in energies and other molecular properties can occur.\nTo address the aforementioned, standard basis sets often augmented with diffuse basis functions when their use is warranted.\n\n2.3.5.1 Pople and Dunning-Style Basis Sets\n\n2.3.5.1.1 Pople-Style Basis Sets\nThis was named after professor John Pople who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his work in quantum chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation for a Pople-Style Basis Set\n\n\n\n\nIn this family, diffuse functions are denoted by having a “+” in their basis sets’ names. Hence, “6-31 + G(d)” means that heavy atoms have been augmented with one additional “one s” and one set of “p” functions that have small exponents.\nA second plus indicates diffuse “s” functions on a hydrogen atom (e.g., “6-3H++G(3d,f 2pd)”).\n\n\n2.3.5.1.2 Dunning-Style Basis Sets\nHere, diffuse functions are indicated by an “aug”; one set of diffuse functions will be added for each angular momentum already present. Hence “aug-cc-pVTZ” has diffuse “s”, “p”, “d”, and “f” functions on heavy atoms and diffuse “s”, “p”, and “d” functions on hydrogen and helium atoms.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Correlation-Consistent Basis Sets\nThese are designed so that have the unique property of forming a systematically-converging set.\nCorrelations with correlation consistent (i.e., cc) basis sets lead to accurate estimates of the complete basis set limit (i.e., CBS) limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation-Consistent Basis Sets\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Mu’s slides lists the notation of cc sets and some examples."

    "text": "5.1 Types of Force Fields\nBS3008 covers three kinds:\n\n5.1.1 AMBER Force Fields\nThese were developed by the Kollman Group at the University of California, San Francisco from the early 1980s until now.\nThe charges in this force field were derived from quantum chemistry calculations at the Hartree-Fock STO-3G level via fitting of partial atomic charges to the quantum electrostatic potential. These forces are called ESP (i.e., Electrostatic potential) charges.\nThe van der Waals terms were adopted from amide crystal data from a research group (i.e., Lifson) and from liquid-state simulations by another research group (i.e., Jorgensen).\nForce constants and idealized bond lengths and angles were taken from crystal structures and adapted to match normal frequencies for a number of peptide fragments.\nTorsion force constants were adjusted to match torsional barriers from experiment or from quantum chemistry calculations.\nThe values in an AMBER force field are closely coupled to non-bonded potentials and are hardly transferrable from one force field to another.\n\n\n5.1.2 OPLS Force Fields\nOPLS is short for Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulation. OPLS force fields were developed by Jorgensen and co-workers at Yale university to simulate liquid-state properties for water and more than 40 organic liquids.\nOPLS force fields placed a strong emphasis on deriving non-bonded interactions in comparison to liquid-state thermodynamics. The earliest application of an OPLS force field was to that of rigid-molecule Monte Carlo simulations of the structure and thermodynamics of hydrofluoric acid (i.e., liquid HF).\n\n5.1.2.1 Change in OPLS Performance\n\n\n\n\n\nRamachandran Plots of an OPLS Force Field\n\n\n\n\nIn 2001, the OPLS-AA performance for peptides was refitted by key Fourier torsional coefficients.\nThis technique uses experimental data as its target to choose a suitable subspace of the whole potential energy surface and to determine weights for each of the fitting points based on gradients.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Results for Liquid Densities, Heats of Vaporization, and Free Energies of Hydration (from left to right)\n\n\n\n\nThe average energy deviation (in root mean squared) from the LMP2/cc- pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G** data has been reduced by 40% from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal / mol due to fitting for electrostatically uncharged dipeptides.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 CHARMM Force Fields\nCHARMM is short for Chemistry at Harvard using Molecular Mechanics; this force field was developed in the early 1980s by the Karplus group. The goal of CHARMM was to obtain a balanced interaction between solute-water and water-water energies when the latter are represented by TIP3P.\nFor peptides, it was found that peptide-water interactions led to peptide-peptide hydrogen bonds that were larger than HF/6-31G values by a factor of close to 1.6.\nLennard-Jones parameters were then refined to reproduce densities and heats of vaporization of liquids (along with unit cell parameters and sublimation heat for crystals).\nQuantum calculations at the HF/6-13G level of hydrogen bond complexes between water and hydrogen bond donors or acceptors of amino acids or fragments.\nThe above set of calculations involves a series of supermolecular calculations of the model compound (e.g., formamide or a single water molecule).\n\n5.1.3.1 Change in CHARMM Force Fields\nIn 2004, a new parameter was introduced such that:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  V_{\\text{cross}} = K_{n, m}(1 + \\cos(n\\phi + m\\psi - \\delta_{n, m}))\n\\end{equation}\\]\nMolecular dynamics simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate force field enhancements.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Applications of Force Fields in Practice\nIn a non-bonded kind of interaction, the van der Waals parameters are; \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). In a bonded interaction, the van der Waals parameters are:\n\nAn equilibrium bond length \\(l_0\\) with a force constraint \\(k\\).\nAn equilibrium angle \\(\\alpha_0\\) with a force constraint \\(k\\)\nTorsional angle terms \\(V_i\\), \\(n_i\\), and \\(\\theta_i\\).\n\nIn a database (i.e., topological library), atom types, partial charges, and chemical bonding information are included."

Many important insights regarding simple liquid behaviors arose from their studies.\nRahman then carried out the first simulation using a realistic potential for liquid argon.\nThe first molecular dynamics simulation of a realistic system was done by Rahman and Stillinger during their liquid water simulation in 1974.\nThe first protein simulations were done in 1977 with the simulation of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (i.e., BPTI) by McCammon and Karplus.\nThe DNA double helix was done by Levitt in 1983. In today’s literature, one typically finds molecular dynamic simulations of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and lipid systems that address a variety of issues (including the thermodynamics of ligand binding and small protein folding).\nBecause of the above, there are many specialized systems for particular problems, including mixed quantum mechanical - classical simulations (that are employed to study enzymatic reactions).\nSimulations are typically used for experimental procedures (e.g., X-ray crystallography and NMR structure determination)."

To calculate a physical quantity \\(A\\) for an ensemble, we would need to calculate the value of the following integral:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  A = \\int \\rho(X) A(X) dX\n\\end{equation}\\]\nUsing Monte Carlo Sampling, the integral becomes:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  A = \\lim_{m \\rightarrow \\infty}\\sum_{i = 1}^MA(X_i)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n7.2.1 Metropolis Algorithm\nThis algorithm - devised in 1953 - is an efficient and simple procedure for the canonical ensemble.\nFor \\(i = 0, 1, 2, ...\\) given \\(X_0\\), we do the following:\n\nGenerate \\(X_{i + 1}'\\) from \\(X_i\\) using a perturbation technique\nCompute \\(\\Delta E = E(X_{i + 1}' - E(X_i)\\)\nIf \\(\\Delta E < 0\\) (i.e., a downhill move), \\(X_{i + 1} = X'_{i + 1}\\), else \\(\\rho = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)\\) - if \\(\\rho\\) is larger than a random number, then \\(X_{i + 1} = X'_{i + 1}\\).\nThe above three steps repeat.\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Markov Chains\nThe metropolis algorithm generates a chain of molecule states \\(\\{X_1, X_2, X_3, ...\\}\\). States that have a lower energy are always accepted, but states with higher energies have a nonzero probability of acceptance too.\nBecause of this, sampling typically occurs in regions of lower energies, but the system can escape to other energy basins by jumping over large energy barriers.\n\n7.2.2.1 BOSS Program\nThe Biochemical and Organic Simulation System (i.e., BOSS) program is a general purpose molecular modeling system that performs molecular mechanics, monte carlo simulations, and other quantum mechanical calculations.\nA monte carlo simulation generates a new configuration via random motions. This difference in energy between the new and the old set is used as a selection criterion in the Metropolis algorithm - this procedure is then repeated and uses internal coordinates\n\n\n7.2.2.2 Z Matrices\nA Z-matrix is used to represent a system made out of atoms - it is also known as an internal coordinate representation.\n\n\n\n\n\nZ-Matrix for Methane\n\n\n\n\nZ-matrices provide a description of each atom in a molecule in term of its atomic number, its bond length, its bond angle, and its dihedral angle (i.e., the internal coordinates).\nThe first line of the above Z-matrix contains a carbon atom (i.e., atom 1).\nThe second line contains a hydrogen atom (i.e., atom 2) the “H 1 1.089000” represents the distance between the hydrogen atom in question and the first atom (i.e., the carbon atom mentioned in the preceding paragraph).\nThe third line states that the bond angle between the first, the second, and the third atom is 109.471 degrees.\nThe fourth line states that the dihedral angle between the current atom and the other three atoms is 120 degrees.\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Comparing Molecular Dynamics and Molecular Computation\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons Between Molecular Dynamics and Molecular Computations"

    "section": "9.1 PDB Files",
    "text": "9.1 PDB Files\nThe first part of the lab examines the structure of a PDB typical PDB file. The later part of this lab then requires you to write your own PDB file for a water molecule (before opening it up in PyMOL to ensure that you have done it correctly.)\nThe Protein Data Bank (i.e., PDB) is an initiative by the Brookhaven National Laboratory that stores three-dimensional data of biological molecules (i.e., biomolecules). A considerable amount of information has since been uploaded to the PDB from various fields in Biology, including but not limited to genomics, proteonomics, and structural biology.\n\n9.1.1 What is a PDB File?\nA PDB file is a plain text document that contains metainformation about a biomolecule - for instance, its atoms, its side chains, and its amino acid residues.\nThe PDB also has official documentation on the structure of its files that you can view for reference.\n\n\n9.1.2 Points to Note\nAlthough a typical PDB file contains numerous section and record types, BS3008 only focuses on a few of these records (and their important parts):\n\nThe ATOM Record\nThis is used to define atoms in a PDB file. With this record, the file writer can also define the positions of the atoms (in a three-dimensional space), define side-chain groups, and also define amino acid residues.\nNote that all coordinates of length will be in Angstroms in a PDB file.\nB-factors\nThis is also known as the temperature factor. B-factors describe how much an atom’s placement differs from its average values - the higher the B-factor, the higher its displacement.\nAreas with high B-factors are usually red (i.e., hot) and vice versa.\nOccupancy\nThis parameter is associated with different conformations of a biomolecule.\nDepending on how many conformations there are available, the occupancy may be less than one (but whatever the case, the values of all occupancices will always add up to one).\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Making a PDB File for a Water Molecule\nA water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its O-H bond length is 0.957 Angstroms and its H-O-H bond angle is \\(109^\\circ\\).\nHence, first set the Oxygen atom to the origin (0, 0, 0) using an ATOM record2:\n         1         2         3         4         5         6         7\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789\nATOM     1   O      A    1      0.000   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            O\nThereafter, add in the first hydrogen atom at the coordinates (0.957, 0, 0) using another ATOM record. It not necessary to use the aforementioned coordinates - (0, 0.957, 0) and (0, 0, 0.957) also work:\n         1         2         3         4         5         6         7\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789\nATOM     1   O      A    1      0.000   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            O\nATOM     2   H      A    1      0.957   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            H\nBasic trigonometry can then be used to discover the coordinates of the final hydrogen atom. In this case:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  x &= -\\cos(71^\\circ) * 0.957 \\\\\n  y &= \\sin(71^\\circ) * 0.957\n\\end{align}\\]\nDoing so should yield a pair of coordinates \\((-0.312, 0.905)\\). The final pair of coordinates (with TER and END records) should be:\n         1         2         3         4         5         6         7\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789\nATOM     1   O      A    1      0.000   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            O\nATOM     2   H      A    1      0.957   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            H\nATOM     3   H      A    1     -0.312   0.957    0.000  1.00 0.00            H\nTER      4\nEND \nYou can open your PDB file in PyMOL to verify that your PDB file is correct."
