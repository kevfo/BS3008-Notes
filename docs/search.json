    "text": "1.1 Discplines in BS3008\nBS3008 covers numerous disciplines, including the following. A brief explanation on what each discipline is is also provided for each of the disciplines:\n\nChemoinformatics\nThis discipline deals with similarities and differences between chemical compounds.\nChemoinformatics deals with compounds from \\(10^{-60}\\) to \\(10^{-30}\\) in magnitudes. Individuals who work in this field try to find “an island in an ocean” - they try to find a molecule that can do some purpose.\nBioinformatics\nThis disciplines applies informatics tools (e.g., Python coding) to Biological molecules and data.\nBioinformatics mainly focuses on Biological modelling.\nTheoretical Chemistry (i.e., Quantum Chemistry)\nThis discipline provides the theoretical foundations needed to understand the course’s contents.\nComputational Chemistry and Biology\nThis discipline not only encompasses theoretical chemistry, but also molecular mechanics, minimization, simulations, and conformational analysis.\nMolecular Modelling\nThis discipline uses all of the above disciplines to represent and manipulate the structures of molecules.\nThis also means that this discipline uses physics to model a system - that way, a model can be compared against experimental results.\n\nHence, BS3008 primarily focuses on molecular modelling (with emphasis on theoretical chemistry for the theoretical component of the course).\n\n1.1.1 What is Molecular Modelling?\nAccording to Tamar Schlick, molecular modelling is:\n\n“…the science and art of studying molecular structure and function through model building and computation.”\n– Tamar Schlick\n\n“Computation” in this sense refer to practices such as:\n\nab initio and semi-empirical quantum mechanics\nMolecular mechanics\nMonte Carlo simulations\nMolecular dynamics\nFree energy and solvation methods\nStructure / activity relationships (i.e., SAR analyses)\nChemical / biochemical information and databases\n\nIt is important to understand that while “model building” can be as simple as using plastic or metal rods to depict molecules’ structures, it can also be as sophisticated as an interactive, animated color graphics and lasers.\nNonetheless, the computational tools used in molecular modelling is just as, if not more complex than Biological systems. However, the concepts in molecular modelling must be carefully applied and one must also be wary of molecular modeling’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n1.1.2 Important Databases and Tools\nProfessor Mu lists some important molecular modelling tools in this chapter - click on their hyperlinks to access them:\n\nPDB\nThis is a database with numerous entries on proteins’ information.\nPDBBinding\nThis is another database that provides entries on the binding affinity for all biomolecular complexes.\nZINK DOCK\n\nAutodock Zina\nThis is an open-source program for performing molecular docking.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Molecular Mechanics in Molecular Modelling\nMolecular modelling started with the idea that molecular geometry, energy, and other molecular properties could be calculated from models (that are influenced by basic forces).\nA molecule - hence - is a system of particles (i.e., atoms) connected by springs (i.e., bonds). This molecule is free to rotate, vibrate, and adopt a favorable conformation in space as a result of the inter- and intramolecular forces acting upon it."

    "text": "2.1 Born-Oppenheimer Approximation\nThis technique in computational chemistry leads to a later concept: potential energy surfaces (i.e., PES). A PES is a graph that describes the energy of a molecule (i.e., a system) in terms of certain parameters\nFor molecules that have many electrons, their wavefunction is a combination of electron and nuclear coordinates. Their wavefunctions can be represented as \\(\\psi(R, r)\\), where \\(R\\) are the nuclear coordinates and \\(r\\) the electron coordinates.\nHowever, nuclei are way heavier than electrons, nuclei also move much slower than electrons.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\psi(R, r) = \\psi_{et}(r; R)\\psi_N(R)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows us to separate electrons and nuclear motion via the above wavefunction approximation.\n\n2.1.1 Schrodinger’s Equation\nThe time-independent Schrodinger equation is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\hat{H}\\psi &= E\\psi \\\\\n  \\hat{H} &= \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{H}\\) is the Hamiltonian, \\(\\psi\\) the wavefunction, and \\(E\\) the total amount of energy in the system.\n\\(T\\) represents kinetic energy and \\(V\\) the potential energy.\n\n\n2.1.2 Solutions of the Schrodinger Equation\nThe equation can only be solved for simple cases (e.g., particle in a box, hydrogen atoms, rigid rotors, etc). For more complex solutions, some assumptions will need to be made.\nSolving this equation also attempts to expand the wave function \\(\\psi\\) into one of many Slater determinants - these are represented by molecular orbitals: linear combinations of atomic-like-orbital functions.\nYet, it is still possible to get very accurate results. Generally speaking, the cost of calculation increases with the accuracy of the calculation (and the size of the system).\n\n\n2.1.3 Electronic Schrodinger Equation\nThis equation is as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\hat{H}_{el}\\psi_{el}(r; R) &=  E_{el}\\psi_{el}(r; R) \\\\\n  \\hat{H}_{el} &= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\sum_i\\nabla_i^2 - \\sum_\\alpha\\sum_i\\frac{Z_\\alpha e'^2}{r_{i\\alpha}} + \\sum_j\\sum_{i > j}\\frac{e'^2}{r_{ij}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn a typical potential energy graph, the potential energy takes a dip within a certain distance before it goes up:\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Energy Graph for HgBr\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above graph, the following formulas can be derived:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  U(R) &= E_{el} + V_{NN} \\\\\n  V_{NN} &= \\sum_\\alpha \\sum_{\\alpha > \\beta}\\frac{Z_\\alpha Z_\\beta e'^2}{r_{\\alpha\\beta}}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n2.1.4 Nuclear Schrodinger Equation\nOnce a potential energy surface (i.e., PES) has been obtained for a molecule, one can solve the nuclear Schrodinger equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\hat{H}_N\\psi_N(R) &= E_N\\psi_N(R) \\\\\n  \\hat{H}_N &= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\sum_\\alpha\\frac{1}{m_\\alpha}\\nabla_\\alpha^2 + U(R)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe solutions of this equation allow one to determine a large amount of molecular properties - for instance, vibrational energy levels.\n\n\n2.1.5 Polyatomic PESes\nWhere there are more than one parameters that are used to describe a molecule’s PES, the degrees of freedom is given by \\(3n - 6\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of atoms in the system."

The eigenfunctions describing these spins are denoted as \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\nElectron spin also obeys the following principles:\n\nIndisguinshability\nAll electrons that are spin-up are identical to one another.\nPauli’s Exclusion Principle\nNo two electrons can be described by the same set of quantum numbers.\n\nWhenever two electrons are interchanged, the signs of their wavefunctions are also changed - for instance:\nIf a wave function \\(\\psi = \\psi_a(1)\\alpha(1)\\psi_b(2)\\alpha(2)\\) is inverted, the result is \\(\\psi_a(2)\\alpha(2)\\psi_b(1)\\alpha(1) - \\psi_a(1)\\alpha(1)\\psi_b(2)\\alpha(2)\\).\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Slater Determinants\nAfter performing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, one then determines the expansion of the electron wavefunction \\(\\psi_{el}\\) via Slater determinants:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\psi_{el} = \\sum_id_i\\phi_i = d_0\\phi_0 + d_1\\phi_1 + d_2\\phi_2 + ...\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe Slater determinant \\(\\phi_0\\) is given via the below matrix. One can also choose to think about Slater determinants as a kind of “configuration” (i.e., ground-state neon might go something like \\(\\psi_0\\) = 1s22s22p6 and so on).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\phi_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\left[\n  \\begin{matrix}\n    \\phi_1\\alpha(1) & \\phi_1\\beta(1) & \\phi_2\\alpha(1) & ... & \\phi_M\\beta(1) \\\\\n    \\phi_1\\alpha(2) & \\phi_1\\beta(2) & \\phi_2\\alpha(2) & ... & \\phi_M\\beta(1) \\\\\n    ... & .... & ... & ... & ... \\\\\n    \\phi_1\\alpha(N) & \\phi_1\\beta(N) & \\phi_2\\alpha(N) & ... & \\phi_M\\beta(N)    \n  \\end{matrix}\n  \\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the spin-up and spin-down functions respectively.\n\\(\\psi_i\\) the spatial functions\n\\(\\psi_i\\alpha\\) and \\(\\psi_i\\beta\\) the spin-orbitals\n\nSlater determinants give proper anti-symmetry (i.e., the Pauli Exclusion Principle).\n\n\n2.2.3 Hartree-Fock Approximations\nIt is impractical (and impossible) to consider all configurations of a system \\(\\phi_i\\). Hence, the Hartree-Fock approximation is often used to approximate the wavefunction for the complete set of \\(\\phi_i\\)s using a single determinant \\(\\psi_0\\).\nIn this method, Self-consistent field energies (i.e., SCF energies) are used instead to find an optimal set of molecular orbitals for \\(\\psi_0\\).\nEach electron in this approximation only sees an average repulsion of the remaining electrons.\n\n2.2.3.1 How Accurate is the Approximation?\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Accuracy of a Hartree-Fock Approximation on a CO Molecule\n\n\n\n\nHartree-Fock wavefunctions usually approximate about 99% of the total energy. Hartree-Fock approximations can also be used to predict bond angles, thermochemistry measurements (e.g., enthalpy), and even vibrational force constants.\nQuantum chemists are typically interested in energy differences and not total energies.\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Electron Correlations\nThe electron correlation is the energy difference between an experimentally measured value (i.e., the “exact” value) and value obtained from a Hartree-Fock approximation. In more empirical terms:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_{corr} = E_{exact} - E_{HF}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe \\(E_{corr}\\) accounts for missing electron-electron interactions in the Hartree-Fock method.\nBecause of this, the Hartree-Fock approximation is often used as a “starting point” for finding the wavefunction.\nDo also note that different correlation methods also exist - depending on which values of \\(\\phi_i\\) and \\(d_i\\) to use, the value of \\(E_{corr}\\) might change.\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Configuration Interactions\nFirst suppose the following about electron wavefunction:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\psi_{el} = d_0\\phi_{HF} + \\sum_{i = 1}d_i\\phi_i\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe above assumption uses the linear variation principle: the amount energy in a wavefunction is always equal to or great than the true energy.\nSome other possible configurations (i.e., methods) include:\n\nCISD\nThis is short for Configuration Interaction with Single and Double excitations. All determinants of “s” and “d” type orbitals are used.\nMRCI\nThis is short for Multireference Configuration Interaction.\n\nBoth CISD and MRCI can be very accurate, but they also take a long time to process.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Mollet-Plesset (i.e., MP) Perturbation Theory\nPerturbation methods such as these assume that the problem at hand (i.e., \\(\\psi\\) and \\(E\\)) only differ slightly from a solved problem (i.e., \\(HF_{\\psi}\\) and \\(E\\)).\nThe energy is calculated via various orders of approximations. At MP2, the calculation involves single and double excitations; higher MPs result in costlier calculations.\n\n\n2.2.5 Coupled Cluster (i.e., CC) Theory\nThis theory leads to accurate wavefunction expansions (and yields accurate electronic charges).\nSome common variants of this include:\n\nCCSD\nWhich includes single and double CCs, hence its name.\nCCSD(T)\nThis is the same as CCSD, albeit with treatments of triple excitations. This method uses accurate results when used on large basis sets.\nIt’s possible to get thermochemical results (i.e., enthalpy) with good accuracy.\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Frozen Core Approximations\nHere, only valence orbitals are involved in chemical bonding processes. Core orbitals don’t change much when atoms are involved in molecules (as opposed to when atoms are free).\nBecause of this, most electronic structure calculations only correlate with the frozen electrons (i.e., the core orbitals are kept frozen).\n\n\n2.2.7 Density Frozen Theory\nThe wavefunction is generally uninterpretable1.\nNonetheless, a useful physical observation would be an atom’s electron density \\(\\rho\\) as it gives the total number of electrons over space.\nDensity Functional Theory solves for electron density. The cost of such method is similar to Hartree-Fock approximations (and usually involve some of empirical parameterization).\nThis approach is often the best choice when dealing with large molecules."

Quantum chemists found via experimentation that \\(M = 3\\) gave the best combination of speed and accuracy.\nTo increase the flexibility of a basis set, one might choose to take a STO-3G basis set and construct two basis functions for each atomic orbital. The first atomic orbital could be a contraction of the first two primitive Gaussians while the second could be a normalized third primitive. A basis with two functions for each atomic orbital is called a double-\\(\\zeta\\) basis.\nMore decontractions are possible - this would give rise to higher, multiple-\\(\\xeta\\) basis sets. More examples of such sets include cc-pCVDZ and cc-pCVTZ.\n\n\n2.3.4 Polarization Functions\nDue to the utility of atomic-orbital-like gaussian type orbitals, this amount of flexibility is often provided in the form of one quantum number higher of higher angular momentum than the valence orbitals. Thus, for a first-row atom, the most useful polarization function are d-GTOs2, and for hydrogens, p-GTOs.\nAdding a d-function to nitrogen’s basis set causes Hartree-Fock approximations to correctly predict a trigonal pyrimidal shape for ammonica.\n\n\n2.3.5 Diffuse Functions\nThe highest-energy molecular orbitals of anions, highly-excited electron states, and loose supermolecular complexes are more spatially diffuse than garden-variety molecular orbitals.\nWhen a basis set doesn’t have enough flexibility to allow a weakly-bonded electron to localize far from the remaining density, significant errors in energies and other molecular properties can occur.\nTo address the aforementioned, standard basis sets often augmented with diffuse basis functions when their use is warranted.\n\n2.3.5.1 Pople and Dunning-Style Basis Sets\n\n2.3.5.1.1 Pople-Style Basis Sets\nThis was named after professor John Pople who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his work in quantum chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation for a Pople-Style Basis Set\n\n\n\n\nIn this family, diffuse functions are denoted by having a “+” in their basis sets’ names. Hence, “6-31 + G(d)” means that heavy atoms have been augmented with one additional “one s” and one set of “p” functions that have small exponents.\nA second plus indicates diffuse “s” functions on a hydrogen atom (e.g., “6-3H++G(3d,f 2pd)”).\n\n\n2.3.5.1.2 Dunning-Style Basis Sets\nHere, diffuse functions are indicated by an “aug”; one set of diffuse functions will be added for each angular momentum already present. Hence “aug-cc-pVTZ” has diffuse “s”, “p”, “d”, and “f” functions on heavy atoms and diffuse “s”, “p”, and “d” functions on hydrogen and helium atoms.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Correlation-Consistent Basis Sets\nThese are designed so that have the unique property of forming a systematically-converging set.\nCorrelations with correlation consistent (i.e., cc) basis sets lead to accurate estimates of the complete basis set limit (i.e., CBS) limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation-Consistent Basis Sets\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Mu’s slides lists the notation of cc sets and some examples."

Hence, we can say that:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_{tot} = E_p + E_k\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(E_{tot}\\) is the total energy of the system.\nSince \\(r\\) represents the distance between both molecules, therefore \\(E_p(r) = 0\\).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\vec{F} = \\frac{\\partial E_p(\\vec{x})}{\\partial \\vec{x}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe force1 \\(\\vec{F}\\) on the system is denoted via the above equation.\nSince \\(E_p(r) = 0\\) in the first figure, it follows that \\(F(r) = 0\\).\n\n\n3.1.2 Case #2\n\n\n\n\n\nA System with Two Charged Molecules\n\n\n\n\nHere, the charge \\(V_{ele}\\) and the potential energy \\(E_p(r)\\) is given via the following equations:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  V_{ele}(r) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{q_1}{r} \\\\\n  E_p(r) &= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSome important considerations to think about include the variables and the parameters of the system.\n\n\n3.1.3 Case #3\n\n\n\n\n\nA System with Two Molecules and their Energy Graph\n\n\n\n\nIn this system, we let:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_p(r) = 4\\epsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this system, we also note that \\(E_p(r) = 0\\) when \\(r = \\sigma\\) and that \\(\\displaystyle E_p(\\sqrt[6]{2}\\sigma) = -\\epsilon\\).\nDo also consider the variables and parameters in this system (and whether or not both particles in this system can move freely).\n\n\n3.1.4 Case #4\n\n\n\n\n\nA System with Two Molecules and their Energy Graph\n\n\n\n\nHere, we define the system’s potential energy \\(E_p\\) as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_p(r) = \\frac{1}{2}k(r - r_0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhile the energy graph for this system appears to be that of bonding, it is still important to consider the variables and the parameters of the system.\nWe can also further decompose the above equation to its spatial components \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) and say that:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nE_p(r) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x - x_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(y - y_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(z - z_0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this sub-case, the system appears to be a lattice. However, are the particles still movable?"

This is in contrast to electrostatic charges and van der Waals forces: intra- and intermolecular bonding.\n\n4.1.1 Bond Stretching\nThe Morse potential \\(E(l)\\) and the Harmonic potential \\(a\\) are:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  E(l) &= D_e\\{1 - \\exp[-a(l - l_0)]\\}^2 \\\\\n  a &= \\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{2D_e}}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\(D_e\\) in the above equations represent the depth of the potential energy minimum:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Potential Energy Graph Between an Oxygen Atom and a Hydrogen Atom\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\omega\\) represents the bond vibration frequency, \\(\\mu\\) the reduced mass, and \\(l_0\\) the reference bond length1\n\n4.1.1.1 At Room Temperature (i.e., 298 K)\nIn such a case, the thermal kinetic energy of the system (i.e., molecule) falls within \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}k_BT\\) and \\(300 K\\). An approximation for the thermal kinetic energy \\(E_{thermal}\\) is about 0.3 kcal / mol. We can also say that:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  E(l) &= \\frac{1}{2}k(l - l_0)^2 \\\\\n  k &= 2D_ea^2 = \\mu\\omega^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nAt room temperature, the energy potential of a molecule can be described via the following graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Potential Energy Well at Room Temperature\n\n\n\n\nThis graph is also called a Hooke’s spring.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Angle Bending\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on Several Bond Angles\n\n\n\n\nBecause of a covalent bond’s directionality, its bond angles do not change that much.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E(\\theta) = \\frac{k}{2}(\\theta - \\theta_0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTherefore, Hooke’s law is often used to calculate the harmonic potential energy of a certain type of bond angle.\n\n\n4.1.3 Torison Terms\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Mu’s Slides on Torsion Terms and Dihedral Angles\n\n\n\n\nThe torsional energy is defined between every quartet of atoms - it depends on the dihedral angle \\(\\phi\\) made by two planes (and also incorporating the first and last three terms in the torsion).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E(\\psi) = \\sum_{n = 0}^N\\frac{V_n}{2}[1 + \\cos(n\\psi - \\psi_0)]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTorsional motions are typically hundreds of times less stiff than bond stretching motions.\nTorsion terms also mimic bonding characteristics and neighboring atoms’ and their side groups’ steric hindrances about the chain axis.\n\n4.1.3.1 Exammple Torsional Terms for Ethane\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Torsional Term for an Ethane Molecule\n\n\n\n\nNote that the y-axis of the above graphic is in kcal / mol.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Non-Bonded Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\nNomenclature for Non-Bonded Interactions\n\n\n\n\nThe kind of bonded interactions depend on the bonding relationship between atoms. Such energy functions in this scenario describe the total interactions between atoms and cannot be further decomposed.\n\n\n4.1.5 Electrostatic Interactions\nThis is a group in its own right - the other group of non-bonded terms is van der Waals interactions.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  E_{ele} = \\sum_{i > j}\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_iq_j}{r_{ij}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn a simple model consisting of two water molecules, their partial charges are \\(q_O = -0.834\\) and \\(q_H = 0.417\\).\n\n4.1.5.1 Calculating Partial Charges\nA molecule’s electrostatic potential can be measured - it can also be determined from molecular wavefunctions (from quantum mechanics):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  R = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{points}}(\\phi_i^{calc} - \\phi_i^0)^2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe goal is to find a set partial charge from which the calculated potentials are closest to the reference ones.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 van der Waals Interactions\nThey arise from a balance between attractive and repulsive forces.\nThe attractive force is due to dispersion forces and is equivalent to \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{r^6}\\). The repulsive force originates from quantum mechanics and can be understood using Pauli’s exclusion principle.\n\n4.1.6.1 Lennard-Jones Potential\nThe Lennard-Jones 12-6 function \\(\\displaystyle 4\\epsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6\\right]\\) has two adjustable parameters:\n\nCollision diameter \\(\\sigma\\)\nWell depth \\(\\sigma\\)\n\nThe \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{r^{12}}\\) is questionable at times, but also allows for rapid computations.\n\n\n4.1.6.2 Combination Rules\nA way to approximate parameters is needed to calculate the van der Waals interactions between different kinds of atoms.\nThere are two methods covered in BS3008:\n\nAmber and Charmm\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\epsilon_{ij} &= \\sqrt{\\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j} \\\\\n  \\sigma_{ij} &= \\frac{\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe Lorentz-Berthelodt rules are used.\nOPLS2 Force Fields\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  \\epsilon_{ij} &= \\sqrt{\\epsilon_i\\epsilon_j} \\\\\n  \\sigma_{ij} &= \\sqrt{\\sigma_i\\sigma_j}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n4.1.6.3 Parameters of van der Waals Forces\nThe Lennard Johnson (i.e., LJ) parameters state the following:\n\nHeat of vaporization\nDensity (i.e., molecular volume)\nPartial Molar Volume\nCrystal simulations"

    "section": "5.1 PDB Files",
    "text": "5.1 PDB Files\nThe first part of the lab examines the structure of a PDB typical PDB file. The later part of this lab then requires you to write your own PDB file for a water molecule (before opening it up in PyMOL to ensure that you have done it correctly.)\nThe Protein Data Bank (i.e., PDB) is an initiative by the Brookhaven National Laboratory that stores three-dimensional data of biological molecules (i.e., biomolecules). A considerable amount of information has since been uploaded to the PDB from various fields in Biology, including but not limited to genomics, proteonomics, and structural biology.\n\n5.1.1 What is a PDB File?\nA PDB file is a plain text document that contains metainformation about a biomolecule - for instance, its atoms, its side chains, and its amino acid residues.\nThe PDB also has official documentation on the structure of its files that you can view for reference.\n\n\n5.1.2 Points to Note\nAlthough a typical PDB file contains numerous section and record types, BS3008 only focuses on a few of these records (and their important parts):\n\nThe ATOM Record\nThis is used to define atoms in a PDB file. With this record, the file writer can also define the positions of the atoms (in a three-dimensional space), define side-chain groups, and also define amino acid residues.\nNote that all coordinates of length will be in Angstroms in a PDB file.\nB-factors\nThis is also known as the temperature factor. B-factors describe how much an atom’s placement differs from its average values - the higher the B-factor, the higher its displacement.\nAreas with high B-factors are usually red (i.e., hot) and vice versa.\nOccupancy\nThis parameter is associated with different conformations of a biomolecule.\nDepending on how many conformations there are available, the occupancy may be less than one (but whatever the case, the values of all occupancices will always add up to one).\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Making a PDB File for a Water Molecule\nA water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its O-H bond length is 0.957 Angstroms and its H-O-H bond angle is \\(109^\\circ\\).\nHence, first set the Oxygen atom to the origin (0, 0, 0) using an ATOM record2:\n         1         2         3         4         5         6         7\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789\nATOM     1   O      A    1      0.000   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            O\nThereafter, add in the first hydrogen atom at the coordinates (0.957, 0, 0) using another ATOM record. It not necessary to use the aforementioned coordinates - (0, 0.957, 0) and (0, 0, 0.957) also work:\n         1         2         3         4         5         6         7\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789\nATOM     1   O      A    1      0.000   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            O\nATOM     2   H      A    1      0.957   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            H\nBasic trigonometry can then be used to discover the coordinates of the final hydrogen atom. In this case:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  x &= -\\cos(71^\\circ) * 0.957 \\\\\n  y &= \\sin(71^\\circ) * 0.957\n\\end{align}\\]\nDoing so should yield a pair of coordinates \\((-0.312, 0.905)\\). The final pair of coordinates (with TER and END records) should be:\n         1         2         3         4         5         6         7\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789\nATOM     1   O      A    1      0.000   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            O\nATOM     2   H      A    1      0.957   0.000    0.000  1.00 0.00            H\nATOM     3   H      A    1     -0.312   0.957    0.000  1.00 0.00            H\nTER      4\nEND \nYou can open your PDB file in PyMOL to verify that your PDB file is correct."
